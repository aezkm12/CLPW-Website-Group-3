            The minute and second hands overlapped,
            it’s Zero Hundred Hours.
            This is the time where everything starts.
            The beginning of the reality which the government is detached. Going through the situation of agony independently.
            Yes it’s like that, we are forced and we have no choice, but to live in misery. <br><br>
            
            Oh, it has been 8 hours since I started,
            and I am not yet done.
            I have dreamt of something different but what I have is holding onto myself, teaching myself to have resilience.
            Resilience in this tiring government who do not understand the hardwork of its neglected citizens.
            And I am not lying or stupid, I am just a working Filipino who stretch their bones in order to provide for our family.
            The feeling of hunger, the feeling of tiredness, the feeling of being neglected, and hopeless.
            Will it all turn to death? We’re just trying to make both ends meet! <br><br>
            
            Is it true that you have to be cruel in order to be kind?
            As I see, deep down, all of you are really shallow.
            Your foolishness of requiring top-of-the-line standards and qualifications.
            But, salary, wage, income are incredibly low.
            Such requirements are like a relentless storm in my life, pushing me to succeed. 
            Yet leaving me drenched in the downpour of pressure, desperately seeking shelter.
            Oh! Our reality is truly bittersweet. <br><br>
            
            Soon it will be midnight.
            And finally, I am finished.
            The remaining 6 hours will serve as my sleep.
            Dreaming that tomorrow will be different, dreaming that tomorrow will be a change, dreaming that my resilience will turn into contentment.
            Tomorrow when it is Zero Hundred Hours.
