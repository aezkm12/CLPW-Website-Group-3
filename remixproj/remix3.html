            Is it true that you have to be cruel in order to be kind?
            As I see, deep down, all of you are really shallow.
            Your foolishness of requiring top-of-the-line standards and qualifications.
            But, salary, wage, income are incredibly low.
            Such requirements are like a relentless storm in my life, pushing me to succeed. 
            Yet leaving me drenched in the downpour of pressure, desperately seeking shelter.
            Oh! Our reality is truly bittersweet.
